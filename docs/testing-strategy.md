# RPS Platform - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the RPS (Rock Paper Scissors) platform to ensure MainNet readiness. Our testing approach covers all critical aspects from smart contract security to frontend user experience.

## 📋 Testing Categories

### 1. Smart Contract Testing

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- **Purpose**: Test individual contract functions in isolation
- **Coverage**: All public functions, error conditions, edge cases
- **Framework**: Anchor + Mocha + Chai
- **Target Coverage**: 100% critical path, 95% overall

**Key Test Areas:**
- Match creation and validation
- Player joining and verification
- Commitment hash integrity
- Reveal mechanism security
- Settlement logic and payouts
- Cancellation and timeout handling

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Test complete game flows and contract interactions
- **Coverage**: End-to-end game scenarios, multi-user interactions
- **Framework**: Anchor + Test helpers

**Test Scenarios:**
- Complete game flows (all winning combinations)
- Concurrent match handling
- Rapid succession games
- Error recovery scenarios
- State consistency validation

#### Security Tests (`tests/security/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate security measures and prevent vulnerabilities
- **Coverage**: Access control, input validation, attack prevention

**Security Validations:**
- Access control enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- Commitment hash integrity
- State manipulation prevention
- Economic attack prevention
- Front-running protection

### 2. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing (`tests/performance/`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure platform can handle expected traffic
- **Metrics**: Throughput, latency, resource usage

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Single game completion: <15 seconds average
- Concurrent operations: 80% success rate for 50+ concurrent matches
- Transaction latency: <5 seconds average, <10 seconds 95th percentile
- Compute unit efficiency: <300k CU per complete game

#### Stress Testing
- **Continuous load**: 30+ seconds sustained operation
- **Burst traffic**: Handle traffic spikes gracefully
- **Resource efficiency**: Memory and compute optimization

### 3. Frontend Testing

#### Component Tests (`app/src/__tests__/`)
- **Purpose**: Test React components and user interactions
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: 80% line coverage, 90% critical path

**Test Coverage:**
- Component rendering and state management
- User interaction handling
- Wallet integration simulation
- Game choice selection and validation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Accessibility compliance

#### End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- **Purpose**: Test complete user journeys
- **Framework**: Custom E2E framework

**User Journey Tests:**
- Patient player complete game flow
- Impatient player cancellation
- Connection loss recovery
- Multiple games between same players
- High-stakes tournament scenarios

### 4. Integration Testing

#### External Dependencies
- Solana RPC endpoint integration
- Wallet adapter compatibility
- Token program integration
- System program interactions

#### Cross-Platform Testing
- Multiple browser compatibility
- Mobile responsive validation
- Network condition simulation

## 🚀 MainNet Validation Suite

### Comprehensive Validation (`tests/validation-suite.test.ts`)

The validation suite runs all critical tests and generates a MainNet readiness score:

#### Critical Path Validation (Required: 100%)
- All winning/tie game scenarios
- Smart contract functionality
- Security measures
- Performance benchmarks

#### Security Validation (Required: 100%)
- Access control tests
- Input validation
- Commitment integrity
- Attack prevention

#### Performance Validation (Required: 95%)
- Latency benchmarks
- Concurrent operation handling
- Resource efficiency

#### Integration Validation (Required: 90%)
- Wallet integration
- Balance updates
- External dependencies

#### Error Handling Validation (Required: 100%)
- Graceful error handling
- Recovery mechanisms
- User feedback

### MainNet Readiness Criteria

**PASS Requirements:**
- ✅ Critical Path: 100% success rate
- ✅ Security: All tests passing
- ✅ Performance: Meeting all benchmarks
- ✅ Integration: All systems working
- ✅ Error Handling: Graceful failure handling

**Overall Score Calculation:**
- Minimum 95% overall score required
- Zero tolerance for critical security failures
- Zero tolerance for critical path failures

## 🔄 Automated Testing Pipeline

### CI/CD Integration (`.github/workflows/test-pipeline.yml`)

**Triggered On:**
- Pull requests to main branch
- Pushes to main/develop branches
- Manual deployment triggers

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Smart Contract Tests**: Unit, integration, security
2. **Frontend Tests**: Component tests, coverage
3. **E2E Tests**: User journey validation
4. **Build Tests**: Contract build, frontend build
5. **Validation Suite**: MainNet readiness check
6. **Security Audit**: Dependency and code scanning
7. **Performance Benchmarks**: Load testing

### Test Execution

#### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:security
npm run test:performance

# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:comprehensive

# Frontend tests
npm run test:app
npm run test:app:coverage
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automatic execution on PR/push
- Parallel test execution for speed
- Artifact collection and reporting
- Automatic deployment blocking on failures

## 📊 Test Reporting

### Automated Reports
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable test results
- **Human Report**: Executive summary with pass/fail status
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage metrics
- **Performance Reports**: Benchmark results
- **Security Reports**: Vulnerability assessments

### Shared Memory Integration
Test results are stored in shared memory namespace `rps-transformation` with key `testing-validation` for team access and integration with other platform components.
