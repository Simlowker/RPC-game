# Security Test Plan - RPS Gaming Platform

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES (CRITICAL)

**A. Incomplete Fund Management**
- Location: `/rps-game/programs/rps/src/lib.rs` lines 227-239
- Issue: Payout logic marked as TODO - funds can be locked permanently
- Risk: Complete loss of user funds
- Impact: HIGH - All deposited funds could be irrecoverable

**B. Missing Refund Mechanisms**
- Location: Lines 273-296 (cancel_match), 295-322 (timeout_match)
- Issue: Refund logic not implemented 
- Risk: Users lose funds even in legitimate cancellations/timeouts
- Impact: HIGH - User funds permanently locked

**C. MEV Attack Exposure**
- Issue: No MEV protection in commit-reveal scheme
- Risk: Front-running and sandwich attacks during reveal phase
- Impact: MEDIUM - Predictable outcomes, unfair gameplay

### 2. DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITIES (HIGH)

**A. Buffer Overflow in bigint-buffer**
- Package: `bigint-buffer` <=1.1.5
- CVE: GHSA-3gc7-fjrx-p6mg
- Impact: HIGH - Potential RCE via Solana operations
- Path: `@solana/spl-token > bigint-buffer`

**B. Development Server Exposure**
- Package: `esbuild` <=0.24.2  
- CVE: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- Impact: MODERATE - Dev server data exposure
- Path: `vite > esbuild`

### 3. WALLET SECURITY ANALYSIS

**A. Proper Implementation Found:**
- Uses standard Solana wallet adapters
- Wallet selection and connection handled by established libraries
- No custom private key handling (GOOD)

**B. Potential Issues:**
- No wallet signature validation on backend
- No protection against replay attacks
- Missing transaction confirmation patterns

### 4. ATTACK VECTORS IDENTIFIED

**A. Smart Contract Attacks:**
1. **Fund Extraction** - Exploit incomplete payout logic
2. **Griefing** - Create matches to lock opponent funds  
3. **Time-based Exploitation** - Manipulate deadlines
4. **Commitment Breaking** - Attempt to break hash commitments

**B. Web Application Attacks:**
1. **XSS** - Via chat/user input (TrollBox)
2. **CSRF** - API endpoints lack protection
3. **Clickjacking** - No frame protection headers
4. **Data Injection** - User metadata manipulation

**C. Economic Attacks:**
1. **MEV Extraction** - Front-run reveals 
2. **Flash Loan Attacks** - Large bet manipulation
3. **Sybil Attacks** - Multiple accounts coordination
4. **Slippage Attacks** - Token price manipulation

## PENETRATION TESTING RESULTS

### Web Application Security

**Tested Endpoints:**
- `/api/chat.ts` - Chat functionality
- Game state endpoints
- Wallet connection flows

**Vulnerabilities Found:**
1. **Input Validation** - Weak sanitization in chat
2. **Rate Limiting** - No protection against spam
3. **CORS** - Overly permissive settings
4. **Headers** - Missing security headers

### Load Testing Requirements

**Target Metrics:**
- 1000+ concurrent users
- <2s response time under load
- <1% error rate during stress
- Graceful degradation patterns

**Smart Contract Load Testing:**
- Solana RPC rate limits
- Transaction failure rates
- Gas optimization under load
- Network congestion handling

## COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Gaming Regulation Compliance

**Required Implementations:**
- Age verification (18+)
- Jurisdiction restrictions  
- Fair play guarantees
- Dispute resolution process
- Responsible gaming tools

### 2. Financial Compliance

**AML/KYC Considerations:**
- Transaction monitoring >$3000
- Suspicious activity reporting
- Customer identification thresholds
- Record keeping requirements

**Current Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### 3. Data Protection

**GDPR/CCPA Requirements:**
- User consent management
- Data portability rights
- Deletion capabilities
- Privacy policy compliance

**Current Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Basic TOS only

## SECURITY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Real-time Monitoring Needs

**Transaction Monitoring:**
- Unusual betting patterns
- Failed transaction spikes
- Large fund movements
- Rapid-fire gameplay

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Response time degradation
- Error rate increases
- Resource exhaustion
- DDoS attack patterns

### 2. Alert Thresholds

**Critical Alerts:**
- Smart contract failures >1%
- Funds locked in incomplete states
- Security vulnerability exploitation
- Compliance violations

**Warning Alerts:**
- Response times >5s
- Error rates >2%
- Unusual user patterns
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL - Fix Before MainNet)
1. Complete smart contract payout implementation
2. Implement refund mechanisms  
3. Add emergency pause functionality
4. Update vulnerable dependencies

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Fix Within 48 Hours)
1. Add MEV protection mechanisms
2. Implement proper input validation
3. Add security headers
4. Set up monitoring infrastructure

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Fix Within 1 Week)
1. Complete compliance framework
2. Add rate limiting
3. Implement audit logging
4. Create incident response plan

## ESTIMATED SECURITY DEBT

**Technical Debt:** ~120 hours of security work
**Compliance Debt:** ~80 hours of legal/regulatory work  
**Testing Debt:** ~40 hours of security testing
**Documentation Debt:** ~20 hours

**Total Security Investment Required:** ~260 hours

This platform is **NOT READY for MainNet deployment** with real funds until critical vulnerabilities are resolved.
