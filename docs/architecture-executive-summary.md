## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Technical Foundation
```
Frontend (React/TypeScript) → API Gateway → Real-time Services
                             ↓              ↓
                        Backend APIs → WebSocket Server
                             ↓              ↓
                      Database Layer → Caching Layer
                             ↓              ↓
                   Blockchain Layer → Monitoring Systems
```
