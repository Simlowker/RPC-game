## 🔍 Detailed Test Results

### 1. Smart Contract Validation ✅

**Program ID:** `4bdQ9U3yXD9EY2SxxMVasPmp5gw7RLtnc8yTkFZovmRR`

✅ **Contract is live on Devnet**
- Account exists with 0.00114144 SOL balance
- Executable: true
- Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111
- Length: 36 bytes

❌ **IDL Issue Found**
- Error: AccountNotFound when trying to fetch IDL
- Impact: Frontend may not be able to interact properly with contract
- Recommendation: Re-deploy with proper IDL setup

### 2. Frontend Deployment ❌

**URL:** https://platform-3gjaelm0v-lowkers-projects-d13a7f0b.vercel.app

❌ **Critical Issue: 401 Unauthorized**
- Frontend is not accessible
- Returns 401 error (Authentication required)
- Impact: Users cannot access the platform
- **BLOCKER:** This prevents all user testing

### 3. Code Analysis ✅

**Configuration Verification:**
- ✅ Program ID correctly configured: `4bdQ9U3yXD9EY2SxxMVasPmp5gw7RLtnc8yTkFZovmRR`
- ✅ Zero fees properly configured: `PLATFORM_FEE = 0.0`
- ✅ Network set to Devnet
- ✅ Proper wallet adapter setup
- ✅ DevNet warning banner implemented

**File Structure:**
```
✅ src/App.tsx - Main application structure
✅ src/config/constants.ts - Proper configuration
✅ src/components/common/DevnetWarning.tsx - User warnings
✅ src/sections/Game/Game.tsx - Game placeholder
✅ package.json - Dependencies configured
```

### 4. Game Implementation Status ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ❌ Game is placeholder only ("Game Coming Soon!")
