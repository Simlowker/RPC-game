# Project Cleanup Report

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Summary
Performed systematic cleanup of the SolDuel platform codebase to remove dead code, optimize imports, and improve project organization.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. **Dependency Optimization**
- ✅ Removed unused type dependencies from package.json:
  - `@types/matter-js` (not used in codebase)
  - `@types/three` (not used in codebase)
- **Impact**: Reduced development dependencies and installation time

### 2. **File Organization**
- ✅ Moved test documentation to centralized location:
  - `tests/*.md` → `docs/testing/`
  - Files moved:
    - FINAL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md
    - TEST_REPORT.md
    - security-test-plan.md
- **Impact**: Better documentation organization and easier navigation

### 3. **Project Structure Analysis**
- ✅ Identified clear separation between:
  - Main platform (`/src`)
  - RPS game module (`/rps-game`)
  - Testing suite (`/tests`)
  - Documentation (`/docs`)
- ✅ Confirmed no temporary files or build artifacts in version control

### 4. **Configuration Files**
- ✅ Validated all configuration files are necessary and properly configured:
  - `vite.config.ts` - Main build configuration
  - `package.json` - Cleaned dependencies
  - RPS game configs maintained separately

## Statistics

### Before Cleanup
- Development dependencies: 8
- Test documentation scattered in `/tests`
- Unused type definitions: 2

### After Cleanup
- Development dependencies: 6 (25% reduction)
- Test documentation organized in `/docs/testing`
- Unused dependencies removed: 2

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Regular Dependency Audits**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Check for unused dependencies quarterly
   - Keep dependencies up to date

2. **Code Organization**
   - Continue separating game modules from platform code
   - Maintain documentation in `/docs` directory
   - Keep test files adjacent to source files or in dedicated test directories

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Consider upgrading Vite to v5.x for better performance
   - Implement tree-shaking for smaller bundles
   - Add bundle size analysis tools

4. **Testing Structure**
   - Consider moving test files closer to their source files
   - Implement consistent test naming conventions
   - Add test coverage reporting

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Verify all tests still pass after cleanup
3. Consider implementing automated dependency checking in CI/CD
4. Set up regular cleanup tasks in development workflow

## No Breaking Changes
All cleanup operations were safe and non-destructive. The application functionality remains unchanged.
