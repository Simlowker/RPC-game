### Cross-Agent Communication Protocols

#### Design Validation Pipeline
1. **System-Architect** → Architecture designs
2. **Security-Manager** → Security reviews & requirements
3. **SPARC-Coord** → Methodology validation
4. **Code-Analyzer** → Technical feasibility assessment
5. **Consensus** → Approved design specifications

#### Security Review Pipeline  
1. **Security-Manager** → Security analysis & threats
2. **System-Architect** → Architecture security integration
3. **Tester** → Security test requirements
4. **SPARC-Coder** → Security implementation patterns
5. **Validation** → Security-approved implementations

## 🔄 Cross-Agent Coordination Protocols

### Daily Sync Pattern
1. **Morning**: Architecture & Security alignment
2. **Midday**: Implementation & Testing coordination  
3. **Evening**: Progress validation & next-day planning

### Decision Escalation Matrix
```
Technical Decisions → System-Architect
Security Decisions → Security-Manager  
Methodology Decisions → SPARC-Coord
Quality Decisions → Tester
Implementation Decisions → SPARC-Coder
```

### Quality Gates
1. **Architecture Review**: System-Architect + Security-Manager approval
2. **Security Validation**: Security-Manager + Tester verification
3. **Implementation Review**: SPARC-Coord + SPARC-Coder validation
4. **Testing Approval**: Tester + Code-Analyzer verification
5. **Final Integration**: All agents consensus
